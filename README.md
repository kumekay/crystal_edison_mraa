## Led Blinking on Intel Edison

[Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) is new language with ruby-like syntax compiled to native code. At it is incredibly fast, compared to ruby.
Another good moment is simplicity of writing **C**-bindings. So it is possible to use for linux-based embedded devices, like Intel Edison.

This code is just quick and rough hello world (led blinking) using bindings to MRAA library.
